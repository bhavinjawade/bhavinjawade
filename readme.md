### Hi! Iâ€™m Bhavin Jawade ðŸ‘‹  

I am a Research Scientist at Netflix Research, working on Multimodal Large Language Models, Reward Modeling, and Reasoning. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University at Buffalo, SUNY, advised by Dr. Venu Govindaraju, where I focused on Multimodal Contrastive Learning, Deep Metric Learning, and Deep Feature Fusion. 

Previously, I was a Research Scientist Intern at Netflix Research, Yahoo Research, and Adobe Research. My work has been supported by IARPA BRIAR, NSF AI Institute, Qualcomm, NSF CITeR, NSF DiBBS, and NSF S&CC programs. I have received the IEEE Best Paper Award at IJCB 2023, the Graduate Leadership Award (2023), and the Russell Agrusa Research Innovation Award (2021).
